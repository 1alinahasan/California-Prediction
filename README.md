# California Housing Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting housing prices in California using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze housing-related features and build a regression model that accurately estimates median house values.

## Dataset
The dataset is based on the California Housing dataset, which includes features such as:
- Median income
- Housing age
- Average number of rooms
- Population
- Latitude and longitude

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Project Workflow
1. Data loading and exploration  
2. Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Model training and evaluation  
5. Performance analysis and predictions  

## Model
A regression-based machine learning model is used to predict median house prices. Model performance is evaluated using standard regression metrics.

## Results
The model demonstrates reasonable predictive performance and highlights the impact of income, location, and housing characteristics on home prices.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run all cells

## Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Trying advanced models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Feature selection and optimization
